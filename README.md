## Funding

To create legimately usable Free software application that are usable and well designed, funding is of utmost importance. This section of the OSD is dedicated to documenting potential avenues of funding as well as providing resources, options towards funding!

### Types of Funding

The main categories of funding that seem most relevant and battled tested in produced decent results are:

- Crowdfunding
- End User Purchases
- Grants
- Industry Partnerships

### Non-Monetary Funding

- Employees who are allowed to work "part-time" on personal projects
- People who commit to finishing X, Y, and Z features (not money but just as good?)
